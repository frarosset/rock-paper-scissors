# rock-paper-scissors
A project from The Odin Project (Foundations).

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissor game website is built using HTML, CSS, flexbox and basic Javascript.
This first version can be played from the Javascript console.
The website will be revisited and impoved over time.

> A preview is available [here](http://frarosset.github.io/rock-paper-scissors).
